The local Isability Athletics Club held its golf day at the Soutpansberg Golf Club with the aim of raising funds for the purposes of development of sport for disabled athletes in the Vhembe District and, more broadly, in the Limpopo Province. Representatives from Isability Gauteng and the Jumping Kids initiative that provides prosthetic limbs to needy amputees were also present and pitted their golfing skills against those of the local golfers.  But, as the saying goes, “Local is lekker” and the local golfers proved their mettle on the day. Fun was had by all and at the end of the day the winning four-ball was the team consisting of Kobus Barkhuizen, Johan Breytenbach, Francois Jonker and Johan Pretorius, with Jay van der Walt, Izak Bosman, Dane Rooi and Inus Steyn in second place. Isability Club members expressed their heartfelt thanks to all the supporters and sponsors of the Isability Golf day, without whom the event would not have been possible. The sponsors included Werda Toyota, OJ’s (Johan Kirsten), Jandrell & Swanepoel, Brink Schlesinger, National Velvet Apiaries, Mattanja Game Breeders, Surat Trading, Premjee’s, Thompson’s Motors, Promo Place, Macridge, Soutpansberg Private Hospital, Limpopo Caterers, SACM, Vreemdeling Farm, Emmanuel Christian School, Emmanuel Church, Icexpress Prosthetics, the Zoutpansberger, Playboy Sport, Budget Insurance, GG-horse Riding, T Fourie, Misty Mountains and Isability Gauteng. The organizers also gave a big vote of thanks to the golf captain, Inus Steyn, the Soutpansberg Golf Club’s committee and members, and all the staff at the club for their help and support. A number of community members also helped with preparation, advice and various tasks before and on the day, and the organizers also extended their heartfelt gratitude to everyone who sacrificed their own precious time in order to be hands and feet for a worthy cause.  In his speech at the prize-giving, Johan Snyders, the director of Icexpress from Gauteng, mentioned that he was humbled and touched by the genuineness of the camaraderie within the Louis Trichardt community that the ‘Gautengers’ had experienced here over the weekend.
