The Soutpansberg will play host to the very popular Akkedis Mountain Bike Challenge in the Komatiland Forests just outside of Louis Trichardt on Saturday, 10 August. The entry fee for the 15km race is R100, R150 for the 35km race and R250 for the gruelling 70km race. The three races will respectively start at 07:30 (70km), 07:45 (35km) and 08:00 (15km). For those who do not have a CSA-license, a R35 fee is payable at registration for a day license. Online entries have already closed. Cyclists can, however, still enter at the Komatiland office on Friday from 15:00 until 17:00 or on the day of the race from 06:30 until 07:30. A R25 late-entry fee will, however, then be payable. A R10 rider fee will also be payable. New to this yearâ€™s Akkedis will also be a 15km trail run, starting at 08:15, and a Kiddies Race (no helmet, no race) starting at 08:30. The entry fee for both events is R50. For more information, phone Chantel du Toit at Tel 082 441 2473.
