Parents, pupils and teachers assembled at the Soutpansberg Primary school to bid farewell to their principal, Ms Adri Kloppers, last Friday. Kloppers retired after 33 years in education. She urged the teachers to work very hard in their profession as well as to further their studies. According to her, she succeeded through her spirit of cooperation with different stakeholders over the 33 years. "I have finally arrived here because of the support from the Department of Education, community members, fellow educators and friends. I would have been wrong to say that this is a one-man battle, because in education, we need each other’s support to succeed. We can only succeed through hard work, unity and dedication." She added that when she started teaching, the profession was characterized by commitment, respect, discipline and loyalty among teachers and their pupils. "It is not like some learners of today, who come to school drunk and armed with knives, showing no respect to teachers and unwillingness to learn,” she said. The deputy principal of the school, Mr Nyambeni Muravha, said that Ms Kloppers was a hardworking leader who played a vital role when the school obtained good results. "We will definitely miss her," he said. He described Kloppers as a dedicated and visionary leader who played a meaningful role in the development of education. "She was always cooperative, readily available and carried out instructions professionally. As a disciplined educator, she worked hard without constant supervision because to her, teaching was not just a career but a way of life." The deputy chairperson of the SGB, Mr George Budzwa, said Kloppers’s exemplary life should serve as a motivation to young teachers. "Everyone can see that she was a great soldier in the teaching profession, and I hope the young teachers will pick up the spear from where she left off. We wish her more health and a deserved rest after such hard work.”
