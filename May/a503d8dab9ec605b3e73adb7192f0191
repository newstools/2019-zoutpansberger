Makoma Makhurupetje, the MEC for Transport and Community Safety in Limpopo, extended her heartfelt condolences to the families of the 14 Zimbabwean nationals who died late yesterday afternoon when the bus they were travelling in, lost control and overturned on the N1 north, near the Ingwe Hotel. The MEC also wished a speedy recovery to others who were injured during the crash. At this stage, the department said, no conclusive evidence has been found which points out the exact cause of the accident, although reckless driving is not ruled out as the possible cause. “We are deeply concerned about accidents involving buses as they lead to more loss of lives compared to ordinary motor vehicles. The driver and vehicle fitness of long distance cross border buses is also a matter of deep concern to us, as this is almost the third time now that we are losing lives because of long distance buses. It is about time that our law enforcement officers step up their routine checks on these buses to prevent this kind of accidents from happening,” said the MEC. “I also call upon drivers of buses and other public transport to take rests in between trips as the lives of passengers remain in their hands,” added Makhurupetje.
