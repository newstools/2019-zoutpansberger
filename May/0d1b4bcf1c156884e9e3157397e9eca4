Police have confirmed that the man arrested in connection with the brutal murder of 51-year-old Ms Annette Kennealy on her farm on Monday morning was indeed her employee, the 40-year-old Kenny Ramatshimbila. According to provincial police spokesperson Col Moatshe Ngoepe, Ramatshimbila appeared in the court in Louis Trichardt yesterday on a charge of murder and house robbery. He was denied bail and will remain in custody until his next court appearance on 1 July for a bail application and further police investigations. Kennealy’s body was discovered in her farmhouse on Tuesday morning after family members failed to reach her by phone and a neighbour went to check up on her. Her body was found in a pool of blood and had severe head injuries, presumably caused by a bloodied hammer found close to her body. It is believed that she was also strangled. Following the discovery of her body, an extensive search began for her killer(s). This led police to Ramatshimbila’s house in Mauluma village in the Nzhelele area where he was arrested on Tuesday evening.
