The Oil Recycling Rocks competition, run by the Wildlife and Environment Society of South Africa (WESSA) on behalf of the ROSE foundation, received more than 60 colourful entries from KwaZulu-Natal, the Western and Eastern Cape, the Free State, the North West and Limpopo provinces. Ridgeway College in Louis Trichardt also took part. Mr Bubele Nyiba, the ROSE Foundation’s CEO, selected a personal favourite artwork for an extra award. The CEO’s Special Award was awarded to Grade 8 learner Kabelo Khutlhelang from Thuto ke Maatla Secondary in Groot Marico. Kabelo has earned a picnic table made from recycled plastic for the school campus. This will be a reminder to all learners that, by recycling waste, something useful and lasting can be created. Alexander Fourie of Ridgeway College was amongst the top 10 and the judges commented that his "impression of oil as a persona devouring the planet, was detailed and horrifically graphic." “Ridgeway Schools continue to strive for a cleaner and greener future and have launched their new Environmental Centre. It is an area where children can explore and experiment within the environmental arena,” said the college’s Ms Astrid Fourie. She added that they were extremely proud that Ridgeway Preparatory School had received Gold status from WESSA as an environmentally aware school. From the school’s side, congratulations also went to Ms Fourie, who has been recognised as an Environmental Champion for her vision and passion for driving the programme.
