The first clashes of the Vhembe T20 league took place on Sunday and provided lots of action and interesting results. Louis Trichardt beat Mohodi Cricket Club on Sunday morning, but Mohodi then proceeded to thrash Giyani in the afternoon. Eltivillas also scored a comfortable victory against Giyani in their earlier match. The best match of the day was probably between Louis Trichardt and Mohodi. Louis Trichardt batted first and got off to an excellent start, thanks to contributions by Dewald Joubert (51 from 38 balls) and Dirk van den Berg (68 not out from 49 balls). Nimesh Watekar (23 from 16) and C Gerber (11 from 10) helped to take the total to 161/5 after 20 overs. Maverick Sedibe was Mohodi’s best bowler, taking 4/28 in four overs. Godfrey Maila (13 from 11) and Khomotso Moshiga (30 from 20) got Mohodi’s innings going, but wickets started tumbling. Kabelo Lehong (12 from 11) and Thabiso Motlhasedi (11 from 10) kept fighting, but it was left to Aubrey Mashalane (46 from 33) to cause a scare. When the last wicket fell in the 19th over, the score stood at 146. Louis Trichardt’s best bowlers were Dirk van den Berg (3/24 in 3), Morné Olwage (2/25 in 4) and Jandré Hancke (2/23 in 4). In the clash between Eltivillas and Giyani, Eltivillas batted first. N Patel (17 from 12) and M Patel (12 from 8) started the innings, but wickets fell at regular intervals. N Driver (16 from 18) steadied the ship but left it to AA Patel (44 from 22) and AI Patel (18 from 12) to score runs. Bhaja Firdaush added 22 from 15 to help take the score to 161/9 after 20 overs. Aubrey Mashalane was Giyani’s best bowler, taking 3/21 in 4 overs. Aubrey Mashalane and
Dingani Mathonsi also took two wickets each. Only three of Giyani’s batsmen could score double figures. Aubrey Mashalane (20 from 23), Dingani Mathonsi (14 from 15) and Lloyd Ngwana (18 from 25) took the score to 88 all out after 17.4 overs. Eltivillas’s best bowlers were Bhaja Firdaush (3/10 in 4), Mahmed Sakil Aiyum Patel (2/23 in 4) and Kasadiya Yunus Dhui (2/17 in 1,4). In the last match of the day, Mohodi came up against Giyani. Giyani batted first and B Vukeya (21 from 13) and N Sithole (10 from 18) started the scoring. Dingani Mathonsi (13 from 12), Lloyd Ngwana (11 from 13) and N Mamatlarume (12 from 21) scored double figures. The last wicket fell in the 19th over with the score on 100. Mohodi’s big stars seem to have been the fielders, effecting no fewer than four runouts. Thabo Mosefowa and Maverick Sedibe took two wickets each. Mohodi’s batsmen wasted no time in chasing the score. Godfrey Maila (54 not out from 33 balls) and T Makoro (19 not out from 9) demolished the bowling attack and passed the required score in the seventh over with only one wicket down. Eltivillas were supposed to play the Univen side, but this match seemingly did not take place. This coming weekend Louis Trichardt and Eltivillas will clash and Giyani will come up against Univen in the morning matches. On Sunday afternoon Louis Trichardt will play against Univen.
