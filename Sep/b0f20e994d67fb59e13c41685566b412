“We are saying no to any form of crime in our area and the only way we should be dealing with this situation is to involve everyone in the community in the fight against such,” said Brig Eddie van der Walt, Makhado Cluster Commander on Saturday during a march and prayer against crime in Louis Trichardt. The march and the prayer session were attended by close to hundred people and included pastors, SAPS members, members of Correctional Services, traffic officials and representatives of provincial departments such as Health and Education. The initiative was also supported by the local business forum. The marchers were led through the streets by the police band. It started at the Makhado SAPS and ended at Soutpansberg Primary School. At the school the keynote address was delivered by Dr Maputha Mulaudzi. He urged communities to see themselves as one family and to fight crime. “United as we are we can fight crime through prayers. Those who say we cannot overcome crime, are blind,” said Dr Mulaudzi. Samson Mphilo from the local community policing forum (CPF) took a swipe at the recent unrest in Pretoria and Johannesburg, saying that the actions resulted in a loss of life, looting and torching of property. “Africa is one and we must live in it as one. This issue of borders has divided us very much. We are one people. Criminals are taking advantage using the name of foreigners. Here in Limpopo we are saying no to any form of crime,” said Mphilo. Meanwhile Van der Walt said that he was happy about the decrease in crime statistics in Makhado. “Recently we went for an award ceremony in Polokwane and the Makhado police station came out number one in the province in reducing crime. Our armed and business robberies have gone down, but we are saying it is not enough,” said Van der Walt. He added that the SAPS and other government departments are holding weekly meetings in an attempt to reduce crime.
