The past Sunday’s planned power interruption is the main reason for the current water shortages in Louis Trichardt. This is according to Vhembe municipal spokesperson Mr Moses Shibambu. “Certain parts of the Makhado Local Municipality didn't have electricity yesterday hence it affected the pumping of water,” said Shibambu on Monday morning. He added that they have already resumed pumping water. Electricity supply to consumers connected to the mountain and Levubu main supply lines was interrupted for most of the day on Sunday to enable the Makhado Municipality to do stringing of conductors for cement poles crossing the existing live lines.
