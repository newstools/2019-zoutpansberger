The wife of missing Louis Trichardt man Mr Johan Koekemoer on Tuesday evening said that people should stop worrying about her husband as he is not missing anymore. The Zoutpansberger spoke to wife Susan Koekemoer just before 18:00. She said that she had spoken to her husband earlier that morning. “A friend of him also later confirmed that Johan is staying with him in Pretoria,” said Susan. The police in Makhado on Monday urged members of the public to come forward if they know anything about the whereabouts of the 46-year-old Mr Koekemoer. According to them, Koekemoer left his home in Louis Trichardt on 8 February this year to travel to Pretoria. He allegedly last contacted his family on 1 March when he called them. Since then, Koekemoer’s phone has diverted all calls to voicemail. The report of Johan going missing was posted on the newspaper's website and Facebook page. The post elicited widespread reaction. At one stage, somebody posted that Johan was found. The Zoutpansberger followed up on this. Just prior to speaking to Susan, provincial police spokesperson colonel Moatshe Ngoepe, however, indicated that they had received no report that he was found and that they are still looking for him. Asked whether Susan reported to the police that she spoke to Johan, she said that she was informed to go to the police station on Friday when Johan returns to cancel the missing person’s report.
