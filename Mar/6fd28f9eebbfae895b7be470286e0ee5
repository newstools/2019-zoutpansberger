The Makhado Fire Brigade is currently on scene at the Makhado Crossing shopping mall in Louis Trichardt where the well-known Crazy Store was gutted by a fire this morning. Emergency services, with the help of on site contractors who had to bring in a water truck to assist, had to scramble to contain the fire to prevent it spreading to neighbouring shops. The mall was filled by â€˜n thick cloud of smoke. At this stage, the exact cause of the fire is still unknown. Click for video.
