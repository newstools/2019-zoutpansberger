The Univen (University of Venda) community learnt with sadness of the demise of one of its veteran lecturers, Mr Melville Jacobz. Jacobz, who lectured in the sociology department for nearly 30 years, passed away on Sunday night in the Zoutpansberg Private Hospital from a heart attack. He was 59 years old. Students and former students will remember him for his vast intellectual abilities, his enthusiasm for presenting lectures and for his (often unorthodox) way of challenging them about his subject matter. He was also a passionate musician who loved his guitar and adored poetry, which he read every day. He is survived by his son, Joshua, his brother, Clive, and his father, Wallace.
