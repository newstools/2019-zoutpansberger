A 47-year-old bank employee was to appear in the Musina Magistrate’s Court today, after she was arrested by the Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation unit on Tuesday for allegedly defrauding a bank client of over a million rand. “The consultant, who is employed by Standard bank in Musina, allegedly invaded a client’s bank account early this month and fraudulently transferred sums of money into different fictitious accounts, where her fellow syndicate members would then allegedly make withdrawals,” said Hawk spokesperson Capt Matimba Maluleke. According to Maluleke, the Hawks’ investigation thus far has uncovered that the consultant allegedly authorized replicated bank cards with a valid pin code on the victim’s account to enable the looting to appear as if it was the client’s transactions. “The suspect is likely to face charges of fraud‚ money laundering and contraventions of Electronic Communications and Transactions Act. Additional arrests cannot be ruled out as investigations continue,” said Maluleke.
