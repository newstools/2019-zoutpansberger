Residents are warned to be on the lookout for fake foreign currency. This after police arrested more suspects in connection with counterfeit foreign money. According to provincial police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo three suspects were arrested with alleged counterfeit money in Musina on at around 11:30 on 17 January. “The police were performing normal patrol duties along the N1 Road in Musina town when they received a tip-off about a suspicious vehicle in the area. The members followed the information and spotted the said vehicle driving at a high speed,” said Mojapelo. A car chase ensued until police managed to stop the suspects' vehicle in town. “The perpetrators attempted to escape but the members acted promptly and apprehended them,” said Mojapelo. The police searched the vehicle and seized 79 fake 100 Euro notes, 220 fake 100 American dollar notes and six 50 American dollar notes. “Further investigations revealed that the suspects earlier tried to buy at one of the shops around town with these fake notes,” said Mojapelo. At the time of going to press the three suspects aged 34, 43 and 57 had yet to appear in the Louis Trichardt Magistrate's Court on a charge of possession of counterfeit goods. In the meantime, the police investigation continues. This above arrest follows about two weeks after a 40-year-old man was arrested in Louis Trichardt also for being in possession of counterfeit money. He was arrested at a local filling station following a tip-off by members of the public. The Mercedes Benz the man was travelling in was stopped and searched. Inside, police found counterfeit money amounting to R179 200 and 149 300 American dollars. The money and the Mercedes Benz were confiscated.
