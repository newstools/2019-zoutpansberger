Louis Trichardt XI scored a convincing victory at their home ground on Sunday and moved into the second spot on the Promotional League of Limpopo Impala Cricket. The victory was partly due to some excellent batting by the two Smit brothers, Wouter and Warno. The home side batted first and lost three early wickets. Dewald Joubert (27 from 21 balls) then started to attack the bowling and the momentum swung Louis Trichardt’s way. He was joined by Wouter Smit, who eventually scored 83 from only 54 balls. After Dewald was caught, AJ Fourie joined Wouter to score a sensible 21 off 30 balls. When AJ lost his wicket, Warno Smit joined his brother and destroyed the bowling attack. His 86 not out came from only 39 balls. Stoffel du Toit (12) helped to take the score to 269/10 after 34 overs. Nkowankowa’s most successful bowler was Mixo Chauke, who claimed five wickets, albeit at a fairly expensive 70 runs in nine overs. Blessing Mabunda (2/62 in 10) and Bapu Zakir (2/55 in 8) also had some success with the ball. Nkowankowa’s batsmen could not find any momentum. Juandré Hancke claimed two quick scalps to make life difficult for them, while Dirk van den Berg and Craig Viljoen kept things tight from the other side. Akani Muswama (17) and Clifford Matwasa (19) tried to steady the ship, but wickets kept tumbling. AJ Fourie then entered the bowling line-up and finished off the tail. The last wicket fell in the 23rd over with the score at 97. AJ Fourie was Louis Trichardt’s most successful bowler, taking 4/22 in 4.1 overs. Dirk van den Berg took 2/3 in 3 overs and Juandré Hancke took 2/51 in 8 overs. Sunday's victory means that Louis Trichardt XI have moved into the second spot on the Limpopo Impala Cricket Promotional League. The leaders are Giyani, two points ahead of Louis Trichardt, with 20 points. This weekend Louis Trichardt have another home match, this time against Seshego.
