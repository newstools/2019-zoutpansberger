This weekend is the deadline to register to vote in the South African general elections this year. These 2019 elections will appoint both new provincial legislatures and a new National Assembly, and determine who the president of the country will be for the next five years. As per the Independent Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC), what is needed to be eligible to register to vote is a green, barcoded South African Identity (ID) Book, a smart ID card, or a valid Temporary Identity Certificate (TIC). A passport, driver’s licence, certified copy of ID or any other form of ID will not be accepted. To follow up on ID-related questions, the IEC referred people to the Department of Home Affairs (DHA). The DHA has announced that its offices will be open during the voting registration weekend from 8:00 to 17:00. Citizens of 16 years and older are eligible to register to vote, but only people 18 years and older are eligible to vote. As well as first-time voters who have to register to be eligible to vote, the IEC states that if you are not registered to vote at the voting station closest to you, you need to update your details. Voting stations are specific to current addresses, so even a short move within town environs could change your voting ward. People who are not properly registered will not be allowed to vote. The easiest way to find your exact voting station is to go to maps.elections.org.za/vsfinder online and enter your street address. This finder will supply the address and directions to your voting station, which will be open for registration on 26 and 27 January between 8:00 and 17:00. For further information, phone 0800 11 8000 or log on to www.elections.org.za. To register before 26 or 27 January, phone the Makhado IEC office, which is situated at Shop 7 at 89 Kruger Street, telephone 015 516 3825.
