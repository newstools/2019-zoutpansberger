The ever-popular Kremetart Cycling Race will take place in the Soutpansberg once more this coming weekend. This year, the Kremetart will be hosted for the 29th time, with the main event being the 175km stage race around the Soutpansberg. The main sponsor, for the first time ever, is ZZ2. Apart from the 175km race, a shorter 70km road race will also be held, as well as a 35km road race for the less fit. The races will be decided on Saturday, 8 June, with all races starting and finishing at the sports grounds of Louis Trichardt High School in Anderson Street. For the start of the race, the N1 will be closed from the Stubbs Street traffic circle in Louis Trichardt to Waterpoort from 06:00 to 09:00. Roads affected by this closure include the Witvlag and Bluegumspoort turn-offs (06:00 to 09:00), the Dzanani/Nzhelele turn-off (06:00-09:00), the Waterpoort turn-off (06:00 to 11:00) and the Musina turn-off (06:00 to 11:00). The R521 (Alldays to Vivo road) will be closed from 09:00 to 14:00, with the Buysdorp/Tshikwarani road being closed from 09:00 to 16:00. The Schoemansdal/Louis Trichardt road will be closed from 06:00 to 17:00. Apart from the main races, a Kiddies Race for the youngsters and a family fun walk in aid of the Endangered Wildlife Trust (see accompanying advertisements) are also on the cards. The public is also welcome to come and support the numerous food stalls at Louis Trichardt High School’s hockey field (opposite the Dutch Reformed Church Soutpansberg) as the main venue for the Kremetart.
