Residents of Louis Trichardt and surrounds may already experience dry taps again, following yet another problem on the main water supply pipeline from the Albasini Dam. “There's a damaged pipeline along the Albasini line and technicians are busy fixing the damage. The repair will be completed today and normal water supply will resume immediately,” said Vhembe District Municipality spokesperson Mr Moses Shivambu. According to Shivambu, the damage was caused by contractors who are working on the Nandoni water project. “We apologize for any inconvenience caused,” said Shivambu.
