Lesley Gaigher of the Louis Trichardt SPCA told the Zoutpansberger that they have “…hit a bit of a rough patch, with finances dwindling.” Tens of thousands of rands are needed every month to do the volume of good work that they do to help animals of all descriptions. For those residents who do not yet follow their updates on their Facebook page, Lesley has shared a few of their upcoming fun fundraisers. The first one is called ‘Donate on Your Birthday’. “Hey, February birthday peeps,” said Lesley. “Love only grows by sharing. You can have more for yourself by giving it away to others. February babies kinda just get this, right? Being born in the month of LOVE, how can it be any different?” The SPCA is asking those born in February to donate on their birthdays and to send high-definition photos of the furry loves of their lives to be featured on the SPCA Facebook page. Then there is their Valentine’s Day Hamper. The hamper is full of delectable sweets, bubbly and bubblebath. A voucher for an intimate dinner at home and something delicious for dessert. All this and much more is on offer to the highest bidder. Lesley said that “You can battle it out online right up until midnight on 13 February. The bidding will open at R600 and rise in increments of R50 (minimum). Only bids on a post on the SPCA Louis Trichardt’s Facebook page will be taken into consideration.” Finally Lesley encourages people to remember to get their orders in for Woofentine’s Cupcakes before 9 February by emailing yolandacronje8@gmail.com. For donations and help, contact Lesley at 071 545 5194 or email her at lesley@gaheritage.co.za or alicia@spcaltt.co.za.
