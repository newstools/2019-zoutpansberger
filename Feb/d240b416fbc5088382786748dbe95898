The six suspects arrested for allegedly defrauding a well-known Louis Trichardt-based company out of more than a millions rands’ worth of fuel is to remain behind bars until their next court appearance. The Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation unit arrested the six suspects, aged between 24 and 37, for alleged fraud and theft on Friday. The group were arrested after a sting operation. Two suspects were arrested at a well-known private company in Louis Trichardt. Shortly afterwards, another four suspects were arrested at a petrol station in Siloam. According to Hawks spokesperson Capt Matimba Maluleke, the six suspects were arrested after investigations revealed that between January and October 2018 the six suspects, two drivers and four petrol attendants, had allegedly connived and unlawfully used the private company’s fuel cards to refuel their own private vehicles and withdraw cash to bribe the attendants in the process. “The investigation revealed that the company lost approximately R1.8 million from the group’s alleged fraudulent activities,” said Maluleke. The six alleged fraudsters appeared in the Dzanani Magistrate’s Court on Monday.  They are Zachariah Maumela (37), Mulalo Maida (36), Tshimangadzo Nekhavhambe (33), Phathutshedzo Masindi (31), Thiathu Ratshivhanda (36) and Ridovuona Malusele (24).
