The Makhado Municipality has given notice of an interruption of electricity supply to consumers on the Roodewal Substation line on Thursday, 14 February, from 12:00 until 15:00. Consumers that will be affected will be the entire mountain line up to Maname Paradise Village and Waterpoort turn-off. “The interruption is necessary to enable the municipality to fix the loose connection at the CT/VT unit (metering unit). No guarantee can be given that electricity supply will be interrupted during the entire specified time. You are therefore warned that the council’s electrical lines must be considered live during the entire period. The interruption will, however, be subject to fair weather conditions,” said the municipality.
