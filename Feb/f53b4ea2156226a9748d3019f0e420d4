It seems as if there is a small glimmer of hope for the struggling waterless residents of the Makhado Local Municipality. Cllr Brian du Plooy, a DA councillor, shared this morning (Friday) on social media that two stand-by pumps were fully restored last night at about 22:00. Due to the extreme slippery access road to the pumps, they started pumping at 06:20 this morning from the raw water pumps and at 07:20 for potable water. “We will start accumulating water in the command reservoir until 14:00 and from 14:00 to 20:00 we will pump directly to the reticulation network. Louis Trichardt town will start receiving water at around 16:00,” he said. Du Plooy also mentioned that there will be no load shedding today, as it also affects the pumping of water. Although we have asked the water authority, the Vhembe District Municipality, for reaction about the water situation and several rumours regarding the cause of the problem, the spokesperson remains mum.
