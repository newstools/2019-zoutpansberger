The Department of Communications, headed by Deputy Minister Pinky Kekana, partnered with the private sector to donate four laptops, 130 tablets, a television set and free Wi-Fi connectivity via fibre optic cable to Louis Trichardt High School last Thursday. Kekana said the connectivity to the Internet would give teachers and learners in rural areas opportunities to stay abreast of the latest teaching trends, guide learners about career choices and facilitate entrepreneurship and social development. Kekana said that her department aimed to give schools access to information and communication technology (ICT) in order to strengthen and expand the learning and teaching processes and to enable the sharing of educational resources and improve administration. She said that her department was working closely with the Department of Basic Education to roll out this access to ICT to all schools as part of fulfilling the mandate of the department to provide universal access to technology. “We obviously cannot complete this massive task on our own, so partnerships with private companies are vital to our success.” She said that their partners had already commenced with the installation of the wider network infrastructure and good progress had so far been made. According to her, 1 210 schools and clinics in Vhembe will benefit from this broadband provision. The principal of Louis Trichardt High school, Mr Louis Cilliers, applauded the donors and government for their donation and said the laptops, tablets and Wi-Fi would help the school and learners a lot. He appealed to other companies to follow the giant step taken by the donors to plough something significant back into the community.
