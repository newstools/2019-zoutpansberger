Eskom has declared Stage 3 load shedding for Tuesday, 12 February. This is likely to continue from 08:00 until 23:00. “Despite the generating units returning to service as planned, the emergency reserves (diesel and water) are still very low,” said Eskom in a media statement. Stage 3 calls for 3000MW to be rotationally load shed nationally at a given period. Load shedding is conducted rotationally as a measure of last resort to protect the power system from a total collapse or blackout. “We continue to appeal to residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand,” said Eskom. From 15:00 until 17:30, load shedding will take place in the Vuwani areas, Nesengani, Louis Trichardt, Valdezia, Levubu, Elim areas, Vleifontein and Sinthumule and Madombidzha areas. As for Tshakhuma, Lwamondo, Shayandima, Muledane, Thohoyandou, Sibasa, Ngovhela, Phiphidi, Gondeni, Vhufuli, Makonde, Tshikweta, Thengwe, Sanari, Masisi, Malale, Muswodi etc and ALL Mutale areas, load shedding will take place from 17:00 until 19:30. Eskom warned that customers should treat all electrical points as live during load shedding.
