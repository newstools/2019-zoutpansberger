The six suspects arrested for allegedly defrauding a well-known Louis Trichardt-based company of more than a million rands’ worth of fuel were all released on bail. “The suspects have appeared in the Dzanani Magistrate’s Court [on Friday, 22 February] and they were granted R2 000 bail each. They will be in the dock again on 26 April,” said Limpopo Hawks spokesperson Capt Matimba Maluleke. The six suspects are Zachariah Maumela (37), Mulalo Maida (36), Tshimangadzo Nekhavhambe (33), Phathutshedzo Masindi (31), Thiathu Ratshivhanda (36) and Ridovuona Malusele (24). The Hawks’ Serious Commercial Crime Investigation unit arrested the six suspects for alleged fraud and theft on Friday, 15 February. The men were arrested after a sting operation. Two suspects were arrested at a well-known private company in Louis Trichardt. Shortly afterwards, another four suspects were arrested at a petrol station in Siloam. Maluleke said that the six suspects had been arrested after investigations revealed that between January and October 2018 the men, two drivers and four petrol attendants, had allegedly connived and unlawfully used the private company’s fuel cards to refuel their own private vehicles and withdraw cash to bribe the attendants in the process. “The investigation revealed that the company lost approximately R1.8 million from the group’s alleged fraudulent activities,” said Maluleke.
