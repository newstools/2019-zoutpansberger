A 30-year-old woman will spend the next 15 years in jail after being convicted of smuggling explosives into South Africa at the Beit Bridge border post. Mtombizitha Ncube was convicted for the possession and smuggling of explosives into South Africa by the Musina Regional Court on Thursday, 31 January. “Ncube was arrested on 26 September 2018, in the company of Marvellous Jore (42), and Musina Shoko (47), when the vehicle they were traveling in was stopped and searched at the Beit Bridge port of entry by customs officials. Ncube and company were en-route from Zimbabwe to South Africa at the time,” said provincial Hawks spokesperson Capt Matimba Maluleke. The resulting search of Ncube’s vehicle uncovered a significant number of hidden explosives with an estimated street value of approximately R200 000. “The Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation unit was enlisted to conduct further investigations, following the arrest. A series of court appearances then followed for the trio after their bail application was successfully opposed by the investigating team,” said Maluleke. The Musina Regional Court convicted Ncube for unlawful possession and smuggling of explosives on Thursday, 31 January 2019, whilst her two co-accused were acquitted. “The court has ordered Ncube to serve 15 years’ imprisonment for unlawful possession of explosives and an additional 15 years for smuggling explosives. Both sentences are to run concurrently,” said Maluleke.
