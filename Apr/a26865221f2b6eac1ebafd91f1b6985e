Mr Moses Shivambu, spokesperson for the Vhembe District Municipality, stated this morning (Thursday) that they are still unable to pump any water from the Albasini Dam. Louis Trichardt and surrounding areas have been without water for a couple of days now due to broken water pumps at the Albasini Dam. Yesterday morning, Shivambu indicated that they will try to start pumping water again once they have managed to fix the broken pump. This did not happen. “There's no water at the Albasini water plant due to the damaged motor. Our office has purchased a new motor which will be delivered on 6 April … so water supply will resume immediately after the installation of the new motor. Water tankering will be available. We apologize for the inconvenience caused. The affected areas include Louis Trichardt and Tshikota,” said Shivambu. It looks like residents will have to endure a couple more days without any drinking water.
