The SAPS’ Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (Hawks) called on workers in the NGO sector who may have been affected by the alleged non-payment of stipends, to contact them. Between 2017 and 2018 the Department of Health allegedly funded Get Ready Information Services based in the Malamulele area (a non-government organisation) to pay a stipend to its workers. It was reported that a stipend was not paid to the workers and they were transferred to other NGO’s like Pfunani Shigamani, Dilonde Aids Awareness and Takalani Home Community Based Care.

The Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation would like to meet with affected individuals in order to expedite their investigations at the Thohoyandou Serious Organised Crime offices situated in Sibasa as follows:

* Pfunani Shigamani Community Home Based Care on 10, 11 and 12 April; * Takalani Home Community Based Care on 15, 16 and 17 April; and * Dilonde Aids Awareness and Home Based Care on 23, 24 and 25 April. For more information, phone W/O M P Mashamba at 071 481 3168, sergeant Q M Mabasa at 071 481 3209 or constable L Ramakulukusha at 071 481 3241.
