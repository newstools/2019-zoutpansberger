The South African Police Service in Musina arrested a 38-year-old woman at the Beit Bridge Border Post on the morning of 28 April for allegedly trying to smuggle illegal explosives into the country. “The suspect was arrested while police were conducting a routine search at the border post. The bus that she was travelling in had just crossed over when it was directed to the searching bay for inspection. During the search, two hundred (200) units of Superpower 90 Blasting cartridges were recovered in her luggage, wrapped inside plastic bags,” said provincial police spokesperson Brig Motlafela Mojapelo on Monday. According to Mojapelo, the origin and destination of the explosives will be determined by ongoing police investigations. “The suspect will appear before the Musina Magistrate's Court soon on a charge of possession of illegal explosives,” said Mojapelo.
