The development of para-sport in Limpopo received a huge boost of encouragement recently when a team of new para-athletes travelled to Stellenbosch to participate in the Toyota 2019 SASAPD (South African Sports Association for Physically Disabled) National Para-sport Championships. Three of these para-athletes came from the 12 Eagle Team from the Collins Chabane Municipality.   After having been introduced to the track events only in 2018 at the Isability Mass participation event held in Louis Trichardt, these athletes showed their potential by bringing home gold, silver and bronze! Ntsieni Hendrick Mambane, who is a single-leg amputee, took first place on the podium with gold in three events, namely the men’s open category F42 javelin, shotput and discus. Hendrick Thinandavha Nemurura achieved silver in the men’s open category F57 javelin, and Vidah Muthubi achieved silver and bronze in the women’s open F43 javelin and discus. A para-athlete from the Makhado Local Municipality, Vumbani Masakona, also managed to achieve silver in the men’s open field javelin event. The athletes are grateful to the Makhado Local Municipality for sponsoring their transport to the event in Stellenbosch. In the ongoing drive to develop more sporting and participation opportunities in the Limpopo, community members with physical or visual challenges who wish to learn more about participating in para-sports are invited to contact some of the athletes or organizers involved in development.  They are the co-ordinator of Disabled Sport in Limpopo, Ernest Netshitanini at 073 455 7034, Hendrik Nemurura at 082 483 8272, Sandy James at 084 506 3333 or Sheryl James at 083 621 9041.
