Connie De Sousa from C Jay’s hair salon in Louis Trichardt has garnered more accolades. On 2 June she attended the Intercoiffure Mondial Congress in Paris with Schwarzkopf as chaperone and was awarded the Chevalier Award, a knight’s pin. But little did she know it would take her to even more greatness. On the weekend of 11 October she attended the Intercoiffure provincial conference in Durban where she was knighted again. Connie told the Zoutpansberger with teary eyes that she never thought this would happen and that she felt honoured to receive such high status in the beauty and fashion industry.
