The SA Post Office would like to inform its customers that they can now renew their post boxes and private bags at any post office or online at www.virtualpostoffice.co.za. The cost of renewal is only R535 per year, while pensioners can rent a post box for a full year at a special discounted rate of only R340. “This ensures complete security and privacy for all your mail. Payment is due by 31 December 2019. After this date, an extra amount of R40 for late payment will be levied,” said the Post Office in a press release. The Post Office said that a post box can be paid at any post outlet countrywide. The customer need not pay at the branch where they rent their post box. People should also take note that free boxes must be renewed as well. “Post boxes offer excellent security for mail items and are particularly useful to companies and individuals who receive important or sensitive items in the mail,” said the Post Office.
