Louis Trichardt Primary School will have the privilege of hosting former Springbok lock Bakkies Botha as motivational speaker during a rugby day on 15 February 2020. On Friday, 14 February 2020, the school will be hosting a coaching clinic on the school’s rugby field, followed by rugby trials for the school’s rugby teams from 07:30 to 10:00 on Saturday, 15 February. Immediately after the trials, Botha will be presenting a motivational session from 10:00 to 13:00 during which he will also be sharing his personal testimony. This session is open to the public and everyone is welcome. A light lunch will be served on this day, which will be included in the price of the ticket and costs R120 per adult, R80 per high school pupil and R50 per primary school pupil. The “boerewors” will be sponsored by Botha. Visitors will be welcome to bring their own cooler boxes with drinks of their own choice. The aim of the day’s events is to serve as motivation for all those planning to attend and participate in next year’s rugby season. The day will be closed with an auction of SA Rugby memorabilia (Botha will be signing rugby balls for the highest bidder for each item). For more information, contact the school at 015 516 5151.
