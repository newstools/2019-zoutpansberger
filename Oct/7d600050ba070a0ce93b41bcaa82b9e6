Louis Trichardt and surrounds are once more experiencing water shortages as a result of yet another pipe burst. Municipal spokesperson for the Vhembe District Municipality (VDM) Mr Moses Shibambu confirmed late yesterday afternoon that the burst had occurred next to pump station 3 (next to the Makhado Show Grounds). “This has left Louis Trichardt and Tshikota Township without water,” said Shibambu. On behalf of the VDM, he apologised for any inconvenience caused. On Tuesday morning, Shibambu confirmed that a contractor had been appointed to fix the pipe burst. He said that the pumping of water would resume immediately after the repair work was completed.
