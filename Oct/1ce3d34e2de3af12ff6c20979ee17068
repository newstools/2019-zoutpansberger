The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) has announced the temporary termination of their long-distance passenger train services, Shosholoza Meyl and Premier Classe, on the Musina, Johannesburg to Port Elizabeth, Cape Town to East London and Komatipoort lines due to “internal challenges”. In a media statement issued on Wednesday, the company said that Main Line Passenger Services (MLPS) management is working around the clock to ensure that both trains are reinstated as soon as possible. “The customer’s needs are always at the heart of the business and we wish to extend apologies to all affected customers for the inconvenience caused,” the statement read. The company gave customers the assurance that they will communicate with them once the decision is taken to reinstate the train services.
