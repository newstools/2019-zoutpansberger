“Whether you call them strays, outdoor cats or community cats, one thing is for sure – feral cats are one of the most misunderstood animal groups.” This is according to the team from Project TNR in Louis Trichardt, who celebrated Feral Cat Day on 16 October. Feral cats are independent cats who live and hunt outside and are not socialized with humans. Project TNR Louis Trichardt is passionate about improving the lives of all cats. Their main focus is implementing the Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) programme – the only humane solution to stabilise and eventually reduce cat overpopulation. “We would like to take this opportunity to applaud the members of our community who are slowly but surely accepting the feral cat colonies that call our neighbourhoods and business districts home. Thank you for caring for these outdoor cats who provide a service by driving down rodent populations in your area,” said the team from Project TNR Louis Trichardt. The team of volunteers also thanked the community who assist in so many ways with funding this costly project. “Thanks to your generosity, we have managed to neuter 200 cats this year so far!” said the team.
