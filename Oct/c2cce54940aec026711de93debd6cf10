On Saturday, 12 October, para-athletes (athletes with physical challenges) will have the opportunity to be evaluated and classified right here in Louis Trichardt. Under the auspices of the SASAPD (South African Sport Association for Physically Disabled), a Limpopo provincial classification event has been arranged to take place from 09:00 until 17:00. Louisa Kirsten, physiotherapist at the Louis Trichardt Memorial Hospital, and one of the few South African international assessors for the classification of para-athletes, will head the panel of classifiers, with two classifiers travelling from Gauteng to form part of the panel. The classification will take place at Louis Trichardt Laerskool’s athletics field and Isability Sports Club Limpopo is assisting with transport and accommodation for the “imported” classifiers. Classification of para-athletes is essential for any athlete who wishes to participate at a provincial, national or international level. Correspondence regarding the opportunity for classification on 12 October has been circulated to clubs in the Limpopo Province.  However, some local disabled athletes might not be members of a club and thus not aware of the day.  Those who are interested in finding out more about how to start their journey as a para-athlete or who would like to be classified are invited to contact Louisa Kirsten (083 561 5983) or Sandy James (084 506 3333 or 015 516 9856).
