Local cyclists spread some Christmas cheer last Friday when they took to the streets as part of the Soutpansberg Cycling Club’s annual Jingle Bell Toy Ride in Louis Trichardt. The “entry fee” for this popular event is a soft toy, which will later be donated to less fortunate children to be handed out over Christmas. Another condition for participation was that cyclists decorate their bikes with Christmas lights, hence the show of colour residents saw riding through the streets.
