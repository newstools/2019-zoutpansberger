The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (PRASA) announced that heavy rains have washed away railway sleepers in the Pienaarsrivier and Tokomane areas, consequently affecting the Johannesburg – Musina - Johannesburg train services. Due to natural disasters, said PRASA in a press release, Main Line Passenger Services (MLPS) was obliged to temporarily suspend the Johannesburg – Musina (return) train service for customer safety. “Booked customers in possession of valid train tickets will be provided with alternative transport to their desired destination. Buses will run in the same running times as the train. Full train services will be reinstated once the infrastructure has been restored and declared safe,” said Ms Daisy Daniel, Head of Marketing and Communications. Customers will be kept informed via an SMS from MLPS and information will also be placed on social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. “MLPS management apologises for the inconvenience caused. We humbly request your patience and understanding as we are striving to get the service back on track soonest,” reads the PRASA press statement. “Customers may also contact the MLPS contact centre at 086 000 8888 for more information,” said Daniel.
