A Hawks takedown operation resulted in the arrest of ten suspects aged between 29 and 54 at Malamulele and Mutale testing stations respectively for allegedly selling drivers’ licences. The arrests on 5 December follows a public outcry since 2017 that the Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation team, in collaboration with Road Traffic Management Cooperation Centre (RTMC), embark on a project-driven investigation aimed at addressing allegations of corrupt activities at the testing stations in the province. “The Hawks’ investigation revealed that the driving licences were sold at a minimum of R8 600 per applicant,” said provincial Hawks spokesperson Captain Matimba Maluleke. The suspects, which include a senior licensing officer, three examiners, two clerks, a cashier, an instructor, a general worker and a middleman, are expected to appear in the Malamulele and Mutale Magistrate Courts respectively today.
