The Vhembe District Municipality urged residents of Louis Trichardt to use water sparingly amidst another problem on the main water supply from the Albasini dam. “The small pump at pump station number three is severely leaking which will affect the flow to the Mowkop reservoir. The big pump will be installed on Friday, 19 July, wherein operation will be back to normal,” said municipal spokesperson Mr Moses Shivambu on Tuesday morning. Shivambu said that as a result of the leak, water pumping to Louis Trichardt Makhado town is compromised. “The community is advised to use water sparingly as water rationalization will be implemented until the situation is normalized,” said Shivambu.
