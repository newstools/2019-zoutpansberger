The organisers of the weekly Parkrun in Louis Trichardt have embarked on a weeklong project to clean the park next to the N1 north of Stubbs street. More volunteers are, however, needed to assist with the project. According to Jaco Voigt, one of the Parkrun organisers, they need assistance with the clearing of bushes and removal of rubbish. He asked all businesses and individuals that can assist with brush cutters, chain saws and workers to please contact them. People who are keen to donate consumables such as petrol are also welcome to contact them. The project already started on Monday morning (22nd) and will last until the end of the week. The Parkrun is a community activity held every Saturday morning where participants walk or run on a five-kilometre route through the park next to the N1. No entry fee is required and the Parkrun is managed by volunteers. For more information or if you can assist, please contact Jaco at 084 616 2299 or Carmina at 076 397 7261.
