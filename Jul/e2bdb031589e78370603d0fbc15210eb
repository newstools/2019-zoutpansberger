On 4 June 2019, friends and family and those who came to love Armando for his loving and energetic personality celebrated his life during a Zumba hour held in his honour. Armando Bianco, son of Jan and Magda Pretorius, sadly passed away on 4 June 2018. His family decided to commemorate this day by hosting a “Zumba with Armando” celebration and to utilise the opportunity to raise funds for the Stabilis Treatment Centre in Pretoria, where Armando had received treatment in the past. Stabilis is an accredited and registered treatment centre that provides treatment programmes for alcohol, medication and drug dependence. A total of R13 000 was raised and donated to Stabilis. Dr Michiel van der Merwe, director of Stabilis, has indicated that they aim to buy something very special with the funds received from this celebration. “It needs to be a motivation to others that sadness and any disappointment have the potential of being turned into a new vision of gratefulness,” he said. The personnel of Stabilis expressed their gratitude for this kind gesture. “May each and every person who took part in this ‘Zumba with Armando’ celebration, every person who donated towards this cause, every person’s presence on the day of the Zumba hour, be favoured in return,” the centre said. “It is Armando’s memory and holding him in our hearts that hold true value and meaning for us.” Armando’s family conveyed their heartfelt gratitude to all other family members and friends and those who knew Armando, for their support, care and love with this initiative. “To this day, even a year later, we receive so many messages of support and encouragement. Thank you to every single person who joined us on 4 June to ‘Zumba with Armando’ for an hour. There are so many people who loved and cared for Armando deeply. So, so many people who reach out to us. The donation shows just how much Armando was loved by all. We appreciate all the love and support from the community, thank you.”
