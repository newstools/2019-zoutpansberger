The swift reaction by members of several specialised Limpopo police units, supported by the Rural Safety Task Team comprising members of the local farm- and town watch structures, led to the interception of a possible trio crime (home and business robberies and hi-jackings) syndicate on Sunday evening. Eleven suspects aged between 32 and 65 were arrested at about 20:00 after the police received a tip-off from members of the community about a group of armed suspects en route from Gauteng to Louis Trichardt, intending to commit business robberies in and around the area. “The operation comprising the Provincial Tracking Team, the Provincial Intervention Unit, the SAPS Makhado, SAPS Bandelierkop, Bandelierkop Farm watch and Soutpansberg Farm- and town watch, was immediately assembled and followed these suspects until they were intercepted,” said provincial police spokesperson Col Moatshe Ngoepe. Following the arrests, several items were recovered including two vehicles believed to be stolen, eight-station signal jammers, monitors used to control alarm systems and angle grinder wheels, drills, balaclavas and gloves. “Police opened cases of conspiracy to commit business robberies, possession of suspected stolen motor vehicles, driving unroadworthy motor vehicle, possession of signal jamming device and possession of housebreaking equipment. These suspects will appear before the Louis Trichardt Magistrate Court soon,” said Ngoepe. Ngoepe said the origin of all the recovered items are still being determined through ongoing police investigations. In the meantime, the provincial police commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba said he remains confident that the police will continue to ensure the safety of residents of Limpopo. He applauded the police and Rural Safety Task Team for their swift reaction upon receiving the information which ultimately led to the dismantling of the syndicate.
