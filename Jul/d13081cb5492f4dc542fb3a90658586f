Two visitors from Bela-Bela managed to win the Louis Trichardt Tennis Day that took place on Saturday. “In the past, this day was an annual event held and attended by many clubs in the region. Over the years, it died down, but the club decided to try and get this special day going again,” said the club’s chairperson, Henk Beukes. The turnout for the event was excellent and even the weather played along nicely. “We are grateful for the big turnout, as even people from Mokopane and Bela-Bela attended the tournament,” said Beukes.
