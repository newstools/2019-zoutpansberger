The mayor of the Musina Municipality, Cllr Mihloti Muhlope, is organising an urgent meeting with the police and community structures to find a way of dealing with the spate of criminal activities in Musina. It follows the death of Ms Sharon Islam (37), wife of businessman Bhabhu Islam, who was killed during an alleged robbery in Musina on Tuesday morning. According to a statement by Col Moatshe Ngoepe, spokesperson for the Limpopo police, it is alleged that a group of armed suspects attacked and robbed the Islam couple at a house in one of the streets in Musina. Mr Islam was injured in the incident and taken to the hospital for treatment. He said that investigations revealed that the suspects have fled the scene with two vehicles, a Ford Focus and a BMW, after they hadÂ robbed the victims of an undisclosed amount of money and cell phones. The suspects involved in this matter are still unknown and there is no arrest yet, Ngoepe said. Anyone with information that can lead to the arrest of these suspects, are asked to phone Capt Richard Boshomane on 079 894 5501 or the Crime Stop number 0860010111 or the nearest police station.
